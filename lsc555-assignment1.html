       <h1>Information System: <a href="https://aad.archives.gov/aad/"> The National Archives Acess to Archival Databases (ADD)</a></h1>
       <h1>System Introduction</h1>
          <h2>Context:</h2>
          <p>The National Archives’ purpose is to keep the nation’s records. While they only keep about 2-5% of federal records created every year, they permanently keep and preserve what they have. Researchers are able to use the ADD to help further their research.</h2>
         <h2>Users:</h2>
         <p>The main users of the ADD are researchers.</p> 
         <h2>Content</h2>
         <p>The National Archives has:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>1.5 billion pieces of paper</li>
               <li>375,220,691 pages of digitized records</li>
               <li>41 million photographs</li>
               <li>More than 33 billion electronic records (1 petabyte in total)</li>
               <li>More than 725,000 artifacts</li>
               <li>40 million aerial images</li>
               <li>More than 450 million feet of film</li>
               <li>10 million maps, charts and architectural.engineering drawings</li>
            </ul>
       <h1>Discussion</h1>
         <h2>Unique/Interesting Features</h2>
            <ul>
             <li>You can browse by category (genealogy, places, time spans, wars/international relations, government spending, and private sector)</li>
             <li>They have sections to show popular, new, and highlighted records</li>
            </ul>
          <h2>Pros and Cons of the System</h2>
            <table>
            <tr>
             <th>Pros</th>
             <th>Cons</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
             <td>Records have tags, which makes it easier to search</td>
             <td>The site is a fixed size, and doesn’t adjust well to different sized screens</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
             <td>The search function tells you the format of the record</td>
             <td>You need to have a specific topic/record that you’re looking for it to be the most helpful</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
             <td>The search function allows you to search by the full name</td>
             <td>Not everything is available digitally, so you might have to go in person to access a record</td>
            </tr>
            </table>
          <h2>Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
          <p>Some documentation is only available in its paper form, which would require you to be in the Nation Archives building to have access to the document. I think it would be an improvement if everything was able to be digitalized or at least transcribed so users did not have to be there in person.</p>
