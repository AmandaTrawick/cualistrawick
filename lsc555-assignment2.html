              <ul>
               <li>It’s not always clear why something is pulled up with a search. Unless it’s in the title or the three lines of the article displayed in the box, it’s not easy to see what makes the article relevant to the search. You have to go into the full article to see if it’s something that you’re looking for.</li>

               <li>The archives box is long and requires you to scroll for a long time to get to the bottom of the page, where the archives is listed again. Anything listed under the page menu will rarely be looked at, so there is a lot of wasted space.</li>

   <h1>Part 1 and Part 2 Comparision</h1>
      <p>There were similar frustrations between parts 1 and 2. When we searched something that was spelled wrong, we were told there were no results and to try again with different terms. It didn’t offer suggestions on what to search instead. Also, it looked for every search term individually. This caused it to pull a lot of articles that were not relevant to the search. We both found it to be well organized and easy to use. There were a few differences. The main difference is the approach we took to reviewing the site. The heuristic analysis is more defined in what I was looking for. The mini-usability test didn’t have as many set points for the person to look at. We looked at different things and focused on different parts of the website. I think improving the search options will help improve the website. Offering suggestions when a search term doesn’t have any results will help when there are misspelled words and help point people in a direction that will show results. I also think the archives box can show the years and expand to show months so the page isn’t so long.</p>
