       <h2>Item metadata & buttons</h2>
       <p>Overall, the buttons meet expectations. The endnote button can be confusing if someone does not know what it is. I tried sending an email through the email button but didn’t receive anything, so it's inconclusive what it does. This could be something that requires the user to be signed in, however, that is not notated. </p>
       <p>The metadata can be spotty at times. As expected, information such as title, publisher, the standard number, the location in the library, and how to access the item is consistently available for items. Metadata about what information the item provides is not always available or easy to find.</p>
